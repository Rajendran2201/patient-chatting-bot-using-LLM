# Model Pretraining for Healthcare Case Studies

## Overview
Model Pretraining for Healthcare Case Studies is a project designed to provide answers to patient questions regarding various healthcare topics. The project utilizes pre-trained language models to generate relevant responses based on input questions. It involves loading pre-trained models, processing patient questions, calculating similarity scores, and generating appropriate answers.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- torch
- transformers
- sentence_transformers
- pandas

You can install these dependencies via pip:

```
pip install torch transformers sentence_transformers pandas
```

## Usage
1. Import the necessary dependencies:

```python
import torch
from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import pandas as pd
```

2. Load pre-trained models and data:

```
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("gpt2")
model_st = SentenceTransformer('paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Sample patient question-answer pairs
patient_data = [
    {
        "question": "What are the symptoms of COVID-19?", 
        "answer": "Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath."
    },
    # Add more patient questions and corresponding answers
]

df = pd.DataFrame(patient_data)
```

3. Define functions for answer generation:

```
def generate_answer(question):
    # Function definition here...

def calculate_similarity(query, embeddings):
    # Function definition here...

def input_text_model(input_text):
    # Function definition here...
```

4. Generate answers for patient questions:

```
# Example usage
patient_question = "symptoms of smallpox?"
answer = input_text_model(patient_question)
print("Patient Question:", patient_question)
print("Generated Answer:", answer)
```

## Data
The provided patient data includes sample questions and their corresponding answers. You can expand this dataset with more patient questions and answers for better model performance.
